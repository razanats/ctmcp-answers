# Explicit state and security

According to the discussion in Chapter 3, there are stationary and movable values as a method of constructing a protective boundary. The former corresponds to lexical scope, and the latter corresponds to Wrap and Unwrap. When constructing a safe data abstraction, the bundled data abstraction can be implemented as a stall value, so safety can be achieved in the lexical scope. The unbundled data abstraction must be rubbed as a moveable value, as its value leaves the hands of the operator.

As we saw in Chapter 3, Wrap and Unwrap require name values and chunks for their implementation. It can be said that explicit state is needed to build a bundled data abstraction because it requires explicit state to generate a name value.
