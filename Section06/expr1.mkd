When we bring the concept of states into a program, the temporal sequence is significant. It is significant that the state at each point can be observed. In the world of declarative models, it can be said that there is no state because the inputs and the outputs to them exist deterministically, and the intermediate calculation process is not required. The real world is stateful, so services that model it, for example, have state (eg, users are interested in the way they join and leave and how much they paid from joining to leaving). I'm not interested in), so it would be nice to be able to handle explicit states as a language.
