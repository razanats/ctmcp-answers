% 4. Program complexity

% The practicality of a program whose% time complexity is a high-order polynomial depends on the assumed problem size. Due to the nature of the problem, there is no practical limit if the size is not limited.
% In addition, there are some areas, such as high-performance computation, where the difference between O(n^3) and O(n^2) becomes very important even for low-order polynomials.
